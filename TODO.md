# TODO: Fix Admin Dashboard Redirect Issue

## Current Issue
- Accessing https://contentai-clean-production.up.railway.app/admin-dashboard.html causes page refresh and redirect to initial page
- Likely due to missing/invalid access token or non-admin user

## Steps to Fix
- [x] Add error handling in frontend/admin-dashboard.js for 401/403 responses to redirect to login
- [x] Verify login flow sets access_token in localStorage properly
- [x] Check admin user status in backend database
- [x] Test admin dashboard access with valid admin token
- [x] Test with invalid/missing token
- [x] Test with non-admin user

## Files to Edit
- frontend/admin-dashboard.js: Add error handling for unauthorized responses
- backend/app/routes.py: Verify JWT and admin checks (if needed)

## Followup
- Test the fix by accessing the admin dashboard URL
- Ensure proper redirect to login on unauthorized access
- User needs to login with admin account: lbiel213@gmail.com / petam004
